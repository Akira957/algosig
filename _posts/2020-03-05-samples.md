## Description

A new and upcoming water bottle supplier is having an 'unlimited samples day' of their product where you as a store owner and buyer will be able to take any combination of water bottles with you as long as it all fits in a duffel bag the supplier provides you. This duffel bag can hold limited weight and you want to make off with the most valuable haul possible.

While the supplier has a limited number of types of water bottles, they do have an unlimited supply of each type. Each type of water bottle has a weight and a value, stored in a tuple with two indices:

```
0. An integer representing the weight of the water bottle in ounces. 
1. An integer represeting the monetary value of the water bottle in USD
```

For example:
```python
# Weighs 13 ounces and has a value of $50
(13, 50)
```

Write a function max_duffel_bag_value() that takes a list of water bottle type tuples and a weight capacity and returns the maximum monetary value the duffel bag can hold. 

For example: 
```python 
bottle_tuples = [(7, 160), (3, 90), (2, 15)]
capacity    = 20

max_duffel_bag_value(bottle_tuples, capacity)
# Returns 555 (6 of the middle type of bottle and 1 of the last type of bottle) 
```

Weights and values may be any non-negative integer. Yes, it is weird to think about water bottles that weigh nothing or duffel bags that can not hold anything. But we are not just super mastermind criminals â€” we are also meticulous about keeping our algorithms flexible and comprehensive.
