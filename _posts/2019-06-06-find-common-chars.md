## Description

Given an array `arr` of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates). For example, if a character occurs two times in all strings but not three times, you need to include that character two times in the final answer.

##### Example:

```python
>>> arr = ["bella","label","roller"]
>>> find_common_chars(arr)
["e","l","l"]
```
