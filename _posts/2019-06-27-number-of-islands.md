## Description

Given a map as an *NxN* grid where land is represented as `1` and water is represented as `0`, count the number of islands in the water. Landmasses must be connected North/South/East/West and not diagonally.

##### Example 1
```python
>>> grid = [
[1,1,0,0,0,0],
[1,1,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,1,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,1],
[0,0,0,0,1,1],
[0,0,0,0,0,0]]
>>> number_of_islands(grid)
3
```
##### Example 2
```python
>>> grid = [
[1,1,0,0,0,1],
[1,1,0,0,0,1],
[0,1,1,0,0,1],
[0,0,1,1,0,1],
[0,0,0,1,1,1]]
>>> number_of_islands(grid)
1
```



## Solution

```python
def number_of_islands(grid) -> int:
    # TODO implement me!
```
