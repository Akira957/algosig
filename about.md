The **Algorithms Special Interest Group (AlgoSIG)** invites attendees of all skill levels to stretch their problem solving abilities with Python. Participants attend our events to learn efficient programming, structured problem solving, and beautiful Python syntax. While some people attend this event in preparation for an upcoming interview to advance their career, others simply enjoy the challenge, learning new tricks, and building a Python community in Chicago.

We cater to each participant‚Äôs abilities by offering three challenges of varying difficulty and assigning a helpful facilitator to each group. At the end of the night, we ask one attendee from each challenge to share their proposed solution and welcome feedback so we may all benefit from attendees‚Äô shared knowledge.

### Join Us!

Our events are held on the first Thursday of the month. [RSVP for upcoming events on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/_ChiPy_/events).
