## How to Add or Edit Posts

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
2. Fork the [repository for this website](https://github.com/chicagopython/algosig) to your GitHub account.
3. On your forked repository, create or edit a [markdown file](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in the `_posts` folder.
    * The filename of your post file should begin with the date (formatted like `YYYY-MM-DD`). 
    * Define these YAML variables at the top of your post:
        ```
        ---
        title:
        author:
        tags:
        ---
        ```
    * Use [markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to write up your content.
4. Commit your changes to your forked repository.
5. Submit a pull request to the `master` branch of [our repository](https://github.com/chicagopython/algosig).
6. Wait for an organizer to review your changes. They will either provide feedback or accept your work right away.
7. Brag about it on the [ChiPy Slack](https://joinchipyslack.herokuapp.com/) `#algorithms` channel!
