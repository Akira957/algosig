## How to Add or Edit Solutions

You'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account before following these steps. Create an account and login before you continue here.

1. At the top of any post on this site, click the **Edit Page** button. This will take you to GitHub to edit the document.
2. On the GitHub page that loads, click **Fork this repository**.
3. Edit the file to add a solution or propose other changes.
  * Use [markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to format your writing.
  * If you'd like, add your name to the `author: ` variable at the top of the post.
4. When you are ready to submit your changes, click **Propose file changes** at the bottom of the screen.
5. On the next screen, click **Create pull request**.
6. Wait for an organizer to review your changes. They will either provide feedback or accept your work right away.
7. Brag about it on the [ChiPy Slack Algorithms Channel](https://chipy.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=algorithms)! If you aren't a member of our Slack group, [sign up here](https://joinchipyslack.herokuapp.com/).
